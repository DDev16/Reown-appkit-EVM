These additions and requests significantly expand the project scope beyond our original $19,500 agreement. Some items I've already completed, others are in progress, and several are new requests that will require substantial additional development time.

While you've mentioned being open to additional compensation for extra features, we haven't yet discussed specific amounts for these substantial additions. Given both the completed work and the expanding requirements, I'd like to schedule a call to discuss fair compensation.

Could we connect when you get a chance and talk about the best way forward?
